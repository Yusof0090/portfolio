2. Define a URL pattern in your `urls.py` file to map the download view function to a specific URL:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import download_file

urlpatterns = [
    path('download/', download_file, name='download'),
]
```

3. In your HTML template, add a download button and link it to the download URL using Django's `url` template tag:

```html
<a href="{% url 'download' %}" class="btn btn-primary">Download</a>
```

This will generate a link to the download view, and the `url` template tag will automatically resolve the URL based on the provided name `'download'` in the URL pattern.

4. Ensure that you have a properly configured media storage setup to serve the files from the media folder. Refer to the Django documentation on handling media files for more information.

When the user clicks the Download button, it will trigger the URL mapped to the `download_file` view. This view returns a `FileResponse` with the appropriate file path and the `as_attachment=True` parameter, which forces the browser to download the file instead of displaying it directly.
